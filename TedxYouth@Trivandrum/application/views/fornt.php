				<p>About TED 
TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.
At a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Three major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with TEDActive, in Whistler, BC; and the TEDGlobal Conference takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.
On TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday. Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by volunteers worldwide into more than 90 languages. Through our distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix and many websites.
The TEDx initiative grants free licenses to people around the world to organize TED-style events in their communities with TED Talks and live speakers. More than 5,000 TEDx events have been held, and selected talks from these events are also turned into TED Talks videos.
The annual TED Prize grants $1 million to an exceptional individual with a wish to change the world. The TED Fellows program helps world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. TED-Ed creates short video lessons by pairing master teachers with animators, for use in classroom instruction or independent learning.

					<p><span><i class="icon-check"></i> What's Tedx ?</span><br/>
					In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxYouth@Trivandrum where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxYouth@Trivandrum event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

				<p>TEDxYouth@Trivandrum TEDxYouth@Trivandrum is the first-of-its-kind event in the state of Kerala, due to be held on the 8th of June, 2013. It aims to exemplify and celebrate ‘ideas worth spreading’. In its inaugural edition, the TEDxYouth conference strives to bring together spirited people, intriguing concepts and mind-blowing innovations to one platform that is specially aimed at engaging the youth. Kaleidoscope As different bits of coloured glass and pebbles come together to weave a beautiful pattern within a kaleidoscope, so do we aspire to bring together some of the most creative ideas, activities and demonstrations to captivate and move our attendees. The event hopes to foster opinion, highlight the need of varied perspectives and incubate the spirit of pursuing passions against odds, amongst other qualities that coalesce to embody the quirky, yet colourful and alluring essence of youth today. As we host and curate this unique conference that seeks to reflect, magnify and echo new beliefs and youthful experiences, we invite you have a look through this kaleidoscope and revel in the novelty it has to offer.</p>
