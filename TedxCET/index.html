<b style="font-weight: bold;">About TED</b> 
</p><p>

		TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.

TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.

TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

		</p><br/>
		
<p><b style="font-weight: bold;">About TEDx</b></p>
<p>
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x=independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.

<b style="font-weight: bold;">About TEDxCET</b>
</p><p>
In the spirit of ‘Ideas worth spreading’ TEDxCET will be held on 2nd Feb 2013 under the guiding theme ‘ Avantgarde’. An attempt to profoundly explore the power of the indispensible ingredient: Unconventional thinking. Its all about having the courage to be the first one to delve into unexplored domains, to challenge and redefine conventional endeavours, and to prove the unproven. Because ‘ We’ve always done it that way’ theory is out of the window. Fire. The wheel. Electricity. Space travel. Mona Lisa. Mt. Rushmore. All of these and countless other uncommon innovations, events, and talents have come from pushing the envelope, reaching beyond what was thought possible, and relying on creativity instead of convention. There is a rather powerful observation by Steve Forbes: “Anyone who accomplishes something great or unique,often does so by defying conventional wisdom.” At TEDxCET we’ll challenge you to take the road less travelled by, inspire followers and give the world what it needs now.
